# DS_Project_Sem_III
A basic Data Structures implementation to create a Tour Guide. 

# Tour Guide Specifications : 
- Entering the number of destinations to visit in a particular city.
- Entering the different routes that can be taken to a destination.
- Entering the time remaining till end of Tour, so that maximum distance can be covered
- Mode of transportation : to get average speed, and hence time required to reach destinations

# Abstract :
- Time required to reach a destination = Speed (Mode of Transportation) / Distance (User-entered)
- The average speed calculated will be used to determine max. no. of destinations that can be covered in the city for the tour
- A Spanning Tree from source -> destination(s) will provide the distances (km) to reach each destination 

# Data Structure Used :
- Disjoint Set Data Structure to Implement Kruskal's Algorithm (Union - Find)
